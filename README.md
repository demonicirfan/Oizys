# MOizys

In Greek mythology, Oizys👸 is the goddess of misery, anxiety, grief, and depression. Our bot **Oizys** is a psychiatric wellness chatbot designed using dialogflow and nodejs.

# Inspiration
😓 We are living in a world where mental illness is labeled as a myth, where people believe that being unhappy is a choice. '

😓 It's 2021, and we might be on a breakthrough in medical science for neurology, oncology, etc, but even today, depression, anxiety is not even considered a medical issue. 

😄 Depression is a real thing, it is not something that can easily be shaken. People dealing with depression want to tell their stories to somebody and they are mostly afraid to speak to their close friends and relatives. Others are not even bothered to help. Oizys will talk to you like the best friend you have never met.

Everyone is familiar with Humans of New York and other inspired channels. Taking the example of Brandon Stanton, founder of Humans of New York, who revealed in one of his interviews how he extracts stories out of people. He picks up a random stranger, and asks him/her few eye-roll-worthy, privacy-invading questions like “what has been the saddest moment of your life?”, and all of a sudden, this person is sharing his/her sorrows, empathy, fears with Brandon. This definitely shows that sometime when we may find it difficult to share our sorrows with family members or friends, it mught be very easy to share it with a stranger, in this case a bot.

# ❓ What it does?
Taking a similar approach to Humans of New York workaround, We built a chatbot that will ask you about your problems indirectly and eventually find you solutions. The bot has been designed to generate empathy and positive emotions. 

# 📚 Introduction

Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner. Most chatbots are either accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant,Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri or via individual organizations’ apps and websites. There are various platforms available to create a chatbot such as msg.ai, wit.ai, Dialogflow, Microsoft Language Understanding.
